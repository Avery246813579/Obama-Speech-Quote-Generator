# Obama Speech Quote Generator
The Obama Speech Quote Generator uses my [Python Rainbow Chain](https://github.com/Avery246813579/Python-Rainbow-Chain) project to generate a quote around an Obama topic. I use a corpus of around 850,000 words from over 200 of Obama's speeches. You can view the project in action [here](https://obama-quote-generator.herokuapp.com/)(it takes a while to load because of Heroku's free tier).
